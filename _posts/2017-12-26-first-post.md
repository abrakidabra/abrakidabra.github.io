Hi all.

My name is Connor and I'm a 20 year old Christian guy from a little town called Moree in Northern New South Wales. I've lived here pretty much all my life, aside from a short stint in Newcastle with my family and an even shorter stint on the Gold Coast. I love wide open spaces, empty roads, flat plains and epic starscapes. In about a week's time I'll be leaving all of that behind to move to the Gold Coast and study at university. Welcome to my blog!

In here you'll find a heck of a lot of random stuff. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time. A long, long time. Almost as long as I can remember. And I find, sometimes, that writing helps... if I can find the energy for it in the depths of whatever pit I'm in. That means that when I do write it's usually all over the place, not very cohesive and often very short (maybe that'll improve as I keep at this thing hey?). Ideally though I want to put something in here every day. This will be like my personal diary, except I'll be putting it out there on the internet for everyone who wants to look. It's a bit scary if I'm honest but it'll force me to care about what I write and make me a little more motivated to create content on a regular basis.

Anyway, it's late here and I should probably be off. There's a load more I wanted to include in this post so that you can get to know me better but it'll have to wait. Remember that thing I mentioned about cohesion? Yeah well I couldn't think of a way to segue into the next bit so I'll get that happening tomorrow sometime. I'm off to the Gold Coast in 7 days so I have until then to fill in my backstory.
