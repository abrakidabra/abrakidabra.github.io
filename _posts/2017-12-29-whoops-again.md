Well it happened again.

I should have spent today packing but instead I spend the morning wasting time and procrastinating, I spent the day at my parent's place with my cousins. And I spent the evening, up until now, with a friend trying to wire in a temperature gauge to his car. 

Ugh. I need sleep. I don't think I'm going to get the backstory done any time soon. Especially if I keep staying up late like this when I should be sleeping well and packing my house. I still haven't got much of that done by the way.

Oh well...
