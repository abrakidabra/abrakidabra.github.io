Despite loving the land out here, I don't think I've ever really fit in. Sure I enjoy things like shooting guns and riding dirt bikes and cute little farm animals. But my real passion, my love for technology, doesn't really have a future out here. Moree has 10,000 people. Not many of them are into computers and electronics. I can't go down to the local tech meetup and collaborate with the people there to code up a website. I can't join a local gaming guild and play board games every Tuesday. Heck I can't even get ADSL internet to my house! Many of the things I enjoy doing just aren't here. So I'm off to the big smoke. 

God is calling me to the Gold Coast to study Engineering and Computer Science at the beginning of next year. He's set up a job for me with Apple (yes, that Apple. I can't believe it either). He's set up an amazing group of friends for me to join and an awesome church to go to. He's prepared me mentally and emotionally for what's about to happen (even though I'm still a little apprehensive) and I'm sure I'll succeed this time around.



So why blogging? This is going to be a bit of a selfish endeavour I'm afraid. I've tried and failed to keep a diary before.

Outline:
 - Who I am
 - What I'm doing
 - Why I'm doing this
 - What content will be on here
